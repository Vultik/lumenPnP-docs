# Nozzle offset

![parts placed with a consistent global offset for only one nozzle](img/nozzle-offset.png){: style="width:60%;margin-left:10%;"}

If parts placed with a specific nozzle have a consistent offset in the X and/or Y axis, there are a couple potential root causes:

- **The nozzle offset for that nozzle needs adjustment.** If OpenPnP doesn't have an accurate idea of how far away a nozzle is from the top camera, it's going to place them with that inaccuracy. [Adjust that nozzle's offset](/openpnp/calibration/6-nozzle-offset).
- **The bottom vision pipeline for your parts needs adjustment.** OpenPnP decides how to place parts onto your board based on what it sees in the bottom camera view. If a bright light or reflective surface in view of the camera is making OpenPnP think your part is a different size than it is, you'll see a placement offset. [Adjust your part identification pipeline](/openpnp/vision-pipeline-adjustment/5).
- **The nozzle's tip calibration needs adjustment.** When OpenPnP performs a nozzle tip calibration, it profiles any runout in the nozzle tip. If this calibration does not correctly identify the nozzle tip, it can cause placement errors.
