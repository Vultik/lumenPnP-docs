## Placement Errors

You might have found an inaccuracy or error when placing parts. This page address these errors, and how to go about fixing them. You might encounter a couple of these errors at once, so choose one to address before moving on.

## Miscellaneous Errors

### Part not picking

![part fails picking](img/mispick.gif)

If the nozzle is not picking parts consistently, there are a few potential root causes:

- **The vacuum sensor threshold is too sensitive.** If you notice that your nozzle is attempting to pick a part, but seems to raise up too quickly, the vacuum sensor threshold value is incorrectly telling OpenPnP that it's successfully picked the part. This can be solved by [tuning your vacuum sensor threshold value](/openpnp/calibration/10-vacuum-sensor).
- **The feeder Z position is set too high.** If the machine is told to pick a part slightly too high, the nozzle tip doesn't make a good seal on the part, and fails to pick. This is solved by adjusting the [feeder's height](../1-installing-the-feeders/index.md).
- **Lack of suction force from the nozzle tip.** Especially for the smallest N045 nozzle tip, some solder paste can get stuck in the tip, reducing suction force. If you cannot see a tiny circle of light shining through the tip when held up to a light, you might need to clean the tip with a thin wire and some isopropyl alcohol.

### "No result found" error

![no parts found error](/openpnp/vision-pipeline-adjustment/images/no-parts-found.png)

- If the component was not identified by the bottom camera correctly, you will likely need to adjust its [Part Identification Vision Pipeline](../../vision-pipeline-adjustment/5-part-identification-pipeline.md).
